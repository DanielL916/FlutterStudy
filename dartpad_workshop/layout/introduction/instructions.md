# Introduction

Welcome to the Flutter workshop `LazyIndexedStack`
written by [Alex Li](https://github.com/AlexV525) ! ðŸ’™

In this workshop, you will learn how to use the `IndexedStack` in your code,
and implement a lazy-loading `LazyIndexedStack` to lazily build children
only when they are first activated.

> The _lazily build_ here indicates the processes of `Widget`s inflating `Element`s are lazy.

This workshop is intended for people who are already
familiar with building simple Flutter apps.

## What is `IndexedStack`?

`IndexedStack` is a `Stack` that
shows a single child from a list of children.
The displayed child is the one with the given _index_.
When the _index_ is null, then nothing is displayed.

## When should I use `IndexedStack`?

`IndexedStack` perfectly suit for the following use cases:

- If you have multiple pages and want to switch between them
  using bottom navigation.
  Typically, the case is when you have different pages together
  in a single route, and only the selected one can be displayed.
- When you have a sequence of widgets you need to display.
  Consider the case that you have a counter but with the image version,
  each increment will display a new image.

## What's next?

Throughout this workshop, you'll convert the `IndexedStack`
into a more efficient, lazy loading `LazyIndexedStack`.
This allows you to save performance cost at the first place.
